/**
 * Grading Program
 * Write a grading program for a class with the following grading policies:
 * 
 * a. There are three quizzes, each graded on the basis of 100 points. 
 * The lowest quiz score is dropped.
 * 
 * b. There is one midterm exam, graded on the basis of 100 points.
 * 
 * c. There is one final exam, graded on the basis of 100 points.
 * 
 * The final exam counts for 45% of the grade. The midterm counts for 35% of the grade. 
 * The three quizzes together count for a total of 20% of the grade; the lowest quiz
 * score is dropped. 
 * 
 * Any grade of 90 or more is an A, any grade of 80 or more (but less than 90) is a B,
 * any grade of 70 or more (but less than 80) is a C, any grade of 60 or more
 * (but less than 70) is a D,and any grade below 60 is an F.
 * 
 * The client program should read in the student’s name and scores and output the student’s record, 
 * which consists of three quiz scores and two exam scores, as well as the student’s overall numeric
 * score for the entire course and final letter grade.
 * 
 * Sample run:
 * Enter student's name:
 * Ada Lovelace
 * Enter the three quiz scores:
 * 90 50 80
 * Enter the midterm score:
 * 70
 * Enter the final exam score:
 * 75
 * 
 * StudentRecord created...
 * 
 * Student: Ava Lovelace
 * quiz1: 90
 * quiz2: 50
 * quiz3: 80
 * midterm: 70
 * final exam: 75
 * overall grade: 75.25
 * letter grade:  C
 * 
 * Define and use a class for the student record. The class should have instance variables for their
 * name, quizzes, midterm, and final exam. 
 * 
 * The overall numeric score is a decimal number in the range 0 to 100, which represents the weighted
 * average of the student’s work. The class should have methods to compute the overall numeric 
 * grade and the final letter grade. Your class should have a toString method that returns
 * a String representation of the StudentRecord object. You may add other methods if you wish.
 * 
 * Note: You should have two classes for this program. One class will be 
 * called StudentRecord.java to encapsulate the student's record along with any methods
 * that operate on this data. A second class will be the client class, 
 * called StudentGrader.java.  The client class will contain the main() method.
