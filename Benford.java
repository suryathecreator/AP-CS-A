/**
 * Benford's law, or the first-digit law, is an observation about the frequency
 * distribution of leading digits in many real-life sets of numerical data. The law states
 * that in many naturally occurring collections of numbers, the leading digit is likely to
 * be small. For example, in sets that obey the law, the number 1 appears as the leading
 * significant digit about 30% of the time, while 9 appears as the leading significant
 * digit less than 5% of the time. If the digits were distributed uniformly, they would
 * each occur about 11.1% of the time. Benford's law also makes predictions about the
 * distribution of second digits, third digits, digit combinations, and so on.
 * 
 * Write a program that tests Benford’s Law. You will use data from two different real-life 
 * data sources. The data is stored in two separate text files: sunspots.txt and librarybooks.txt
 * Feel free to try this program out on other large sets of data! 
 *
 * You will also be tested on a third mystery file of stock data and a file of randomly 
 * generated integers.
 * 
 * 
 * You will loop through the list of numbers and count how many times 1 is the first
 * digit, 2 is the first, etc...
 * 
 * Your output/results should look like this:
 * 
 * Analysis of library book data:
 * [33.4, 17.6, 11.1, 8.8, 7.0, 6.1, 5.5, 5.5, 4.9]
 * Analysis of sunspot data:
 * [29.1, 12.4, 10.3, 10.6, 10.2, 8.6, 6.5, 6.6, 5.8]
